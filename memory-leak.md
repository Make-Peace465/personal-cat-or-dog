That is an absolutely brilliant question. It gets to the heart of what's known as **state management** in programming.

The check is there to prevent a common and tricky bug: **creating multiple, runaway intervals if the user clicks the 'start' button more than once.**

Let's walk through what would happen *without* that check.

---

### The Bug Scenario (Without the Check)

Imagine your `changeColor` function was simply this:
```javascript
// BROKEN VERSION - DO NOT USE
function changeColor() {
  // No check, just set the interval every time
  intervalId = setInterval(flashText, 1000); 
}
```

Now, let's trace what a user does:

1.  **First Click (Time = 0s):**
    *   The user clicks "start".
    *   `changeColor()` runs.
    *   `setInterval()` is called. It starts a new interval and returns a unique ID, let's say `1`.
    *   The variable `intervalId` is now `1`.
    *   The box starts flashing every second, controlled by interval #1.

2.  **Second Click (Time = 2s):**
    *   The user gets impatient and clicks "start" **again**.
    *   `changeColor()` runs again.
    *   `setInterval()` is called **again**. It starts a *completely new, separate interval* and returns a *new* unique ID, let's say `2`.
    *   The variable `intervalId` is now overwritten and becomes `2`.
    *   **The Problem:** You now have **TWO** intervals running at the same time! Interval #1 is still running in the background, but you've lost its ID. Interval #2 is also running. The box will now flash erratically as both intervals fight to change its class.

3.  **Third Click (Time = 5s):**
    *   The user clicks "stop".
    *   `stopTextColor()` runs.
    *   It calls `clearInterval(intervalId)`. What is the value of `intervalId`? It's `2`.
    *   Interval #2 is successfully stopped.
    *   **The Catastrophic Bug:** Interval #1 is **still running in the background forever!** You have no way to stop it because you lost its ID when you overwrote the `intervalId` variable. This is called a **memory leak**. The page will continue to use CPU resources to run this "ghost" interval.

### How the `??=` Check Solves the Problem

The line `intervalId ??= setInterval(flashText, 1000);` is a very clever and modern way to prevent this bug.

The `??=` operator is the **"nullish coalescing assignment"** operator. It's a shorthand that means:

> "If the variable on the left (`intervalId`) is `null` or `undefined`, then assign it the value from the right. Otherwise, do nothing."

Let's re-trace the user's clicks with the correct code:

1.  **First Click (Time = 0s):**
    *   `changeColor()` runs.
    *   It checks `intervalId`. At the start, it's `undefined`.
    *   Because it's `undefined`, the condition is met. The code on the right runs: `setInterval()` is called.
    *   `intervalId` is assigned the new ID, `1`.
    *   The box starts flashing.

2.  **Second Click (Time = 2s):**
    *   `changeColor()` runs again.
    *   It checks `intervalId`. The value is now `1` (it is not `null` or `undefined`).
    *   Because it's not nullish, the condition is **not** met. The code on the right, `setInterval(...)`, is **never executed**.
    *   Nothing new happens. The bug is completely prevented.

3.  **Third Click (Time = 5s):**
    *   `stopTextColor()` runs.
    *   It calls `clearInterval(1)`. The interval is stopped.
    *   It then sets `intervalId = null;`. This is crucial! It "resets the state," making the `intervalId` variable nullish again, ready for the next time the user wants to start.

### The Analogy

Think of it like a kitchen mixer.
*   **Without the check:** It's like having a mixer with only an "ON" button. If you press "ON" five times, you now have five motors trying to spin the same whisk, and you only have a reference to the last motor you started.
*   **With the check:** It's like a mixer with a proper "ON/OFF" state. If it's already "ON," pressing the "ON" button again does nothing. You have to turn it "OFF" first before you can turn it "ON" again. The `intervalId` variable is what stores that "ON/OFF" state (`a number` means ON, `null` means OFF).
